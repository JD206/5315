      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker runs "containers" which bundle their own tools, libraries, and configs. This allows applications to handle their own dependencies when interacting with the OS, rather than needing to worry about having all of the required software libraries and drivers for all of the different applications the OS might run. This greatly simplifies deploying software, as dependencies essentially don't need to be considerd when running from containers vs "normal" installation. source:  www.docker.com, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ie8negCjc</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a web server that was released in 2004, with a supporting company founded in 2011. Nginx was created with the goal of outperforming Apache webserver, which was released much earlier, in 1995, when the internet was a very different place. Nginx has achieved that goal, as according to some, it can handle 4x the request load on equivalent hardware when compared to Apache, assuming both are out-of-the-box and unmodified. source: www.nginx.com, wikipedia.org</p>
      <h2>What is a VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>Virtual Machines are software defined computers that allow for flexible, SW defined allocation of the equivalent of physical hardware. They sit, essentially, on top of hardware, but under the OS. The Hypervisor controls the allocation of hardware. This allows for the rapid scaling up and down of computers - frequently servers - so they can scale to demand as needed, avoiding the costs associated with standing up an expensive and capital-intensive datacenter. Can also provide test environments on local machines, allowing developers to run an OS in a virtual machine to test software for a different environment, for instance.  source: VMware.com, wikipedia.org</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean?</h2>
      <p>Digital Ocean is an IaaS company based in NYC. Provides VMs (called droplets) and storage. There are many IaaS providers, but this space has seen some consolidation recently, so there are fewer than there used to be. Other major offerings in this space come from Microsoft (Azure), and Amazon (AWS). source: www.digitalocean.com, www.google.com, www.microsoft.com, www.amazon.com</p>
